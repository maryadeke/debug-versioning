DEFINITION OF BUGS
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in the source code of any software

DEFINITION OF A BUGS
A bug is an error in code that prevents it in the way it was intended

a bug is  a glitch that prevents the program from achieving desired output

TYPES OF BUGS
1.syntax errors; these occur when the code doesnot follow syntatical rules
 eg "<div classhome><div>", 
mistyping or incorrect usage of statements of variables, functions

2. logic errors; these occur when  the steps taken to perform the task correctly are not well done eg an infinite loop

3. design bugs; this is a bug caused by por and or inadequate design decisions.eg poor user interface(UI), Wrong data types, 
                or its a bug that is carried from the dsigners to the actual implementation of the code

4. runtime errors; these are errors that cant be noticed until the code is run.
eg diving a variable by a null value, dividing a number by zero, adding a string to an integer

WHY IS DEBUGGING IMPORTANT
1. to remove errors from code
2. to saves resources ie time and money
3. enables developers to improve productivity and efficiency

HOW DO WE DEBUG 
The 5p's - Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance

DEBUGGING PRINCIPLE
=>Bugs caught early, right after uve made them are the easiest to fix 
bse the details are fresh in your mind and u know exactly where to look 

=>once bugs escape they become very hard to find ie since u most likely
 dont have the details of the codein your mindand the code has grown

 THE DEBUGGNG CYCLE
   1. coding(writing the code)
   2. testing( checking the code functionality)
   3. if the code is working as intended, proceed to develop the code
   4. if the code is not working, go on to Debugging
   5. then repeat cycle as they all go

   A BUG SEEKING CYCLE
      Difference between debugging and testing;
      Debugging is wat i can do to fix erronous code while testing is what i need to do to break my code
      
STEPS OF DEBUGGING
1. Plan ur attack
2. backup your files(interchangeable) using versin control ie github to keep track fo changes in my software
3. isolate the block of code that could have the error ie commenting it
4. finding the actual line/ lines with the error or bugs
5. fix the error, dont patch it
6. test the fix youve jhs done
7. look for similar bugs
